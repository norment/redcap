## Overview

MultiSense Hub-Node is an initiative designed to support researchers
using University of Oslo's Services for Sensitive Data (TSD) for collecting
and organizing **sensitive, multimodal datasets**---including clinical,
genetic, neuroimaging, registry, and socio-economic information---by
providing standardized, reproducible, and user-friendly data
infrastructure.

The project focuses on enabling **secure data organization,
harmonization, quality assurance, and analysis workflows** within TSD,
ensuring compliance with legal,
ethical, and security requirements for handling protected research data.

This service complements Nettskjema on TSD, which is used for secure data collection,
by organizing already collected data and linking complex multimodal datasets 
into a coherent resource accessible to researchers within a TSD project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Scope

MultiSense aims to help addressing key challenges in modern data-intensive research:

-   Integration of **heterogeneous multimodal data sources**
-   Standardization and **harmonization across studies and formats**
-   Reproducible and **scalable analytical workflows**
-   Secure handling of **person-sensitive information**
-   Improved **data quality control and metadata organization**
-   Readiness for **distributed and collaborative analyses** across
    infrastructures

By operationalizing these capabilities in TSD, the project aims to make
advanced data management and analysis **accessible to a broad range of
research users**, independent of technical background.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## REDCap in MultiSense

A central component of the hub is **REDCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture)**, a widely used secure web-based platform for managing
research data.

Key characteristics of REDCap:

-   Used by **thousands of institutions worldwide** for clinical and
    research data capture
-   Provides **role-based access control**, audit trails, and secure
    data handling
-   Supports **structured data collection, validation, and real-time
    quality checks**
-   Enables **direct export** to common analysis environments (e.g., R,
    Python, SPSS)
-   Facilitates **integration of questionnaire data, clinical variables,
    imaging metadata, and omics data**
-   Aligns with **regulatory, legal, and interoperability standards**
    for sensitive research data

Within MultiSense, REDCap is deployed as a **core database layer** to
curate, connect, and prepare multimodal datasets for downstream
statistical analysis and machine learning.

## What the Hub Delivers

MultiSense Hub-Node develops and provides:

1.  **Production-level REDCap deployment in TSD**
    -   Secure storage and structured organization of multimodal data
    -   Tools for curation, validation, and quality assurance
    -   Integration with questionnaire-based data collection workflows
    -   User-friendly interfaces for non-technical researchers

2.  **Multimodal data linkage and harmonization**
    -   Connection of genetics, imaging, clinical, and registry data
    -   Metadata organization aligned with national and international
        standards
    -   Support for reproducible and distributed analyses

3.  **Training, documentation, and user support**
    -   Written guides and example research workflows
    -   Coordinate workshops and user meetings
    -   Long-term sustainability through shared community knowledge

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Operational Goal

The primary objective is to **fully operationalize MultiSense services
within TSD**, making secure multimodal database infrastructure:

-   **Available to new and existing research projects**
-   **Sustainable beyond initial funding**
-   **Scalable to national and international collaborations**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Intended Users

MultiSense is designed for:

-   Researchers handling **sensitive human data**
-   Projects requiring **multimodal data integration**
-   Teams needing **secure databases and reproducible workflows**
-   Users seeking **accessible tools without extensive IT
    specialization**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Sustainability

The hub emphasizes:

-   **Documented installation and operational procedures**
-   Reusable **training materials and course content**
-   Community-driven **user forums and shared support**
-   Continued **scaling and maintenance within TSD infrastructure**

This ensures long-term availability of secure multimodal data management
for the research community.
